                            With eFootball PES 2020, we've taken the same critically acclaimed console gameplay that won E3 2019's "Best Sports Game" award, and distilled its essence to bring you the most authentic mobile soccer experience to date. Take creative command of the ball like never before thanks to the brand-new "Finesse Dribble" technique, developed in collaboration with iconic Spanish midfielder Andrés Iniesta. Other enhancements to trapping and overall ball control will also enable you to take advantage of small differences in the way each player plays on the field. We've also added the "Inspire" system, which allows certain players to influence the way in which nearby teammates behave. The sum total of these parts is an experience that accentuates player individuality, lending increased importance to choosing the right players for the right situations and tweaking your formation to perfection.
